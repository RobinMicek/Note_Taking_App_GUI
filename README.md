# Note_Taking_App_GUI

Simple app for taking notes.
The app gives you a page, where you can write your notes. When you’re done, hit “Save” and then “Quit” to close the app.

Next time you open it, it will contain all the notes you have written.
You can also start from scratch by clicking on “Delete all notes”.

Build on Python 3.8.
Before running, don’t forget to install all libraries from “requirements.txt.”.
